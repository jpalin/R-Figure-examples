This repository shows some example R and Python figures I have created throughout both my professional career and academic studies.

## Clinical Trials (R programming)
Below are some of examples of clinical trial analyses, these figures submitted to the pharma company working on the development of a novel therapy. Note the data has been replaced with dummy data.

## Football Referee Decisions Analysis (using data provided by Opta, R programming)
The goal of this project was to investigate football referee decisions, specifically the following questions: 

Q1) Does a referee issuing early cards lead to a fairer match?

Q2) Do referees perform differently when judging disciplinary actions?

Q3) Are referees influenced by previous games they have officiated?

Q4) Does a refereeâ€™s game management change after the first card?

Some of the key plots are shown below:

## Image classification of aerial oceanic imagery (using open source images, Python programming) 
The goal of this project was to classify areial oceanic imagery into three classes: Ocean only, Ships present and Unknown Floating Objects.
The custom convolutional neural network classifier designed could be used in search/retrival operatations after air disasters over open ocean.

Some of the key plots to evaluate performance of the best performing model are shown below:
